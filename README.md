Project for CIS 393 (Kaboom Pizza Ordering System)

Some things to note:
- Run app.js to start the express web server. This is the only file that needs to be ran to host the entire website.
- The homepage can be found at localhost:8080/HomePage.html
- The database is used to track customer orders. It contains customer information, order details, and the status of their order.
- Customers can place orders through the checkout page. When they place an order, that order is sent directly to the database. They can also track their orders from this page as well.
- The manage orders page would normally be hidden for regular users and would only been seen by the employees. It's currently visible for easy access. Under the manage orders page, employees can display all orders, search orders, delete orders, and update the status of orders. 
- The order status is updated to let customers know when their order is ready for delivery or pickup.
